# Javascript-DLC

A Javascript library for working with [Discreet Log Contracts](https://adiabat.github.io/dlc.pdf).

A [sample](./sample) is provided as an example usage of this library.

Contributions are welcome.
Check the [contributing](./docs/Contributing.md) and [development](./docs/Development.md) documents for more information.

## Warning

This library is still in early stage and while test coverage is decent it has not been thoroughly tested in production yet.
We thus recommend avoiding using it on main-net at the moment.

## Status

The implementation is mainly based on the [DLC specifications](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs) but is not yet fully compliant with it
