## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Javascript DLC is a library for Discreet Log Contracts

## 2. Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Explain how to set up and get your project running.

### 2.1 Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

List the software and tools that users need to have installed on their system before they can use your DLC. For example:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Git

### 2.2 Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Provide step-by-step instructions for users to install and set up your DLC. This might include cloning the Git repository and installing dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AreaLayer/javascript-dlc.git

# Change to the project directory
cd javascriptdlc

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## 3. Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Explain how users can use your DLC in their own projects. Provide code examples, explanations, and any configuration details.

```javascript
// Example code demonstrating how to use your DLC
const dlc = require('dlc');

const result = dlc.doSomething();
console.log(result);
```

## 4. Testing <a name="testing"></a>

Detail how users can run tests to ensure the stability and correctness of your DLC.

### 4.1 Running Tests

Provide instructions on running tests. Use a testing framework like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

```bash
# Run tests
npm test
```

### 4.2 Writing Tests

Explain how users can write their own tests for your DLC. Include guidelines and best practices.

```javascript
const { executeDLC, verifyDLCResult } = require('./dlc-utils'); // Replace with your DLC utility functions

test('DLC Execution Test', () => {
  // Set up the DLC parameters and contract
  const dlcParams = {
    oracleSignature: 'mock_oracle_signature',
    oraclePublicKey: 'mock_oracle_public_key',
    contract: 'your_dlc_contract_details', // Replace with your contract
  };

  // Execute the DLC
  const dlcResult = executeDLC(dlcParams);

  // Verify the DLC result
  const expectedOutcome = 'expected_outcome'; // Replace with your expected outcome
  const isDLCSuccessful = verifyDLCResult(dlcResult, expectedOutcome);

  // Assert the test
  expect(isDLCSuccessful).toBe(true);
});
```

In this example, we have a test case for a DLC execution. You'll need to replace the executeDLC and verifyDLCResult functions with your actual implementation. The dlcParams object should contain the necessary parameters for your DLC, and you should set the expectedOutcome to what you expect the outcome of the DLC to be.

Make sure that you have the appropriate testing infrastructure in place and that your executeDLC function simulates the execution of a DLC using the provided parameters. The verifyDLCResult function should compare the actual outcome of the DLC to the expected outcome and return true if they match.

Before running the test, ensure you've installed Jest and configured it for your project. You may also need to set up mock objects or utilities for the DLC-specific functions, such as executeDLC and verifyDLCResult, to facilitate testing.
