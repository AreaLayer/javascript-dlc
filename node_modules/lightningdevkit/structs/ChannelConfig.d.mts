     * # HTLC-based Dust Exposure
     *
     * When an HTLC present in one of our channels is below a \"dust\" threshold, the HTLC will
     * not be claimable on-chain, instead being turned into additional miner fees if either
     * party force-closes the channel. Because the threshold is per-HTLC, our total exposure
     * to such payments may be substantial if there are many dust HTLCs present when the
     * channel is force-closed.
     *
     * The dust threshold for each HTLC is based on the `dust_limit_satoshis` for each party in a
     * channel negotiated throughout the channel open process, along with the fees required to have
     * a broadcastable HTLC spending transaction. When a channel supports anchor outputs
     * (specifically the zero fee HTLC transaction variant), this threshold no longer takes into
     * account the HTLC transaction fee as it is zero. Because of this, you may want to set this
     * value to a fixed limit for channels using anchor outputs, while the fee rate multiplier
     * variant is primarily intended for use with pre-anchor channels.
     *
     * The selected limit is applied for sent, forwarded, and received HTLCs and limits the total
     * exposure across all three types per-channel.
     *
     * # Transaction Fee Dust Exposure
     *
     * Further, counterparties broadcasting a commitment transaction in a force-close may result
     * in other balance being burned to fees, and thus all fees on commitment and HTLC
     * transactions in excess of our local fee estimates are included in the dust calculation.
     *
     * Because of this, another way to look at this limit is to divide it by 43,000 (or 218,750
     * for non-anchor channels) and see it as the maximum feerate disagreement (in sats/vB) per
     * non-dust HTLC we're allowed to have with our peers before risking a force-closure for
     * inbound channels.
     *
     * Thus, for the default value of 10_000 * a current feerate estimate of 10 sat/vB (or 2,500
     * sat/KW), we risk force-closure if we disagree with our peer by:
     * `10_000 * 2_500 / 43_000 / (483*2)` = 0.6 sat/vB for anchor channels with 483 HTLCs in
     * both directions (the maximum),
     * `10_000 * 2_500 / 43_000 / (50*2)` = 5.8 sat/vB for anchor channels with 50 HTLCs in both
     * directions (the LDK default max from [`ChannelHandshakeConfig::our_max_accepted_htlcs`])
     * `10_000 * 2_500 / 218_750 / (483*2)` = 0.1 sat/vB for non-anchor channels with 483 HTLCs
     * in both directions (the maximum),

     * in both (the LDK default maximum from [`ChannelHandshakeConfig::our_max_accepted_htlcs`])
     *
     * Note that when using [`MaxDustHTLCExposure::FeeRateMultiplier`] this maximum disagreement
     * will scale linearly with increases (or decreases) in the our feerate estimates. Further,
     * for anchor channels we expect our counterparty to use a relatively low feerate estimate

     * and feerate disagreement force-closures should only occur when theirs is higher than ours.
