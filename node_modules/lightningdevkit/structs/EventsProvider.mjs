/**
 * A trait indicating an object may generate events.
 *
 * Events are processed by passing an [`EventHandler`] to [`process_pending_events`].
 *
 * Implementations of this trait may also feature an async version of event handling, as shown with
 * [`ChannelManager::process_pending_events_async`] and
 * [`ChainMonitor::process_pending_events_async`].
 *
 * # Requirements
 *
 * When using this trait, [`process_pending_events`] will call [`handle_event`] for each pending
 * event since the last invocation.
 *
 * In order to ensure no [`Event`]s are lost, implementors of this trait will persist [`Event`]s
 * and replay any unhandled events on startup. An [`Event`] is considered handled when
 * [`process_pending_events`] returns `Ok(())`, thus handlers MUST fully handle [`Event`]s and
 * persist any relevant changes to disk *before* returning `Ok(())`. In case of an error (e.g.,
 * persistence failure) implementors should return `Err(ReplayEvent())`, signalling to the
 * [`EventsProvider`] to replay unhandled events on the next invocation (generally immediately).
 * Note that some events might not be replayed, please refer to the documentation for
 * the individual [`Event`] variants for more detail.
 *
 * Further, because an application may crash between an [`Event`] being handled and the
 * implementor of this trait being re-serialized, [`Event`] handling must be idempotent - in
 * effect, [`Event`]s may be replayed.
 *
 * Note, handlers may call back into the provider and thus deadlocking must be avoided. Be sure to
 * consult the provider's documentation on the implication of processing events and how a handler
 * may safely use the provider (e.g., see [`ChannelManager::process_pending_events`] and
 * [`ChainMonitor::process_pending_events`]).
 *
 * (C-not implementable) As there is likely no reason for a user to implement this trait on their
 * own type(s).
