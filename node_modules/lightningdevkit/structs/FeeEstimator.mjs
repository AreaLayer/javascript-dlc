 * A trait which should be implemented to provide feerate information on a number of time
 * horizons.
 *
 * If access to a local mempool is not feasible, feerate estimates should be fetched from a set of
 * third-parties hosting them. Note that this enables them to affect the propagation of your
 * pre-signed transactions at any time and therefore endangers the safety of channels funds. It
 * should be considered carefully as a deployment.
 *
 * Note that all of the functions implemented here *must* be reentrant-safe (obviously - they're
 * called from inside the library in response to chain events, P2P events, or timer events).
 *
 * LDK may generate a substantial number of fee-estimation calls in some cases. You should
 * pre-calculate and cache the fee estimate results to ensure you don't substantially slow HTLC
 * handling.
