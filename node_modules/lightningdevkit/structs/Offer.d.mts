/**
 * An `Offer` is a potentially long-lived proposal for payment of a good or service.
 *
 * An offer is a precursor to an [`InvoiceRequest`]. A merchant publishes an offer from which a
 * customer may request an [`Bolt12Invoice`] for a specific quantity and using an amount sufficient
 * to cover that quantity (i.e., at least `quantity * amount`). See [`Offer::amount`].
 *
 * Offers may be denominated in currency other than bitcoin but are ultimately paid using the
 * latter.
 *
 * Through the use of [`BlindedMessagePath`]s, offers provide recipient privacy.
