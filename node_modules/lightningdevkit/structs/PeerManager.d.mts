/**
 * A PeerManager manages a set of peers, described by their [`SocketDescriptor`] and marshalls
 * socket events into messages which it passes on to its [`MessageHandler`].
 *
 * Locks are taken internally, so you must never assume that reentrancy from a
 * [`SocketDescriptor`] call back into [`PeerManager`] methods will not deadlock.
 *
 * Calls to [`read_event`] will decode relevant messages and pass them to the
 * [`ChannelMessageHandler`], likely doing message processing in-line. Thus, the primary form of
 * parallelism in Rust-Lightning is in calls to [`read_event`]. Note, however, that calls to any
 * [`PeerManager`] functions related to the same connection must occur only in serial, making new
 * calls only after previous ones have returned.
 *
 * Rather than using a plain [`PeerManager`], it is preferable to use either a [`SimpleArcPeerManager`]
 * a [`SimpleRefPeerManager`], for conciseness. See their documentation for more details, but
 * essentially you should default to using a [`SimpleRefPeerManager`], and use a
 * [`SimpleArcPeerManager`] when you require a `PeerManager` with a static lifetime, such as when
 * you're using lightning-net-tokio.
