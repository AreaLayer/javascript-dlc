/**
 * Similar to [`KeysManager`], but allows the node using this struct to receive phantom node
 * payments.
 *
 * A phantom node payment is a payment made to a phantom invoice, which is an invoice that can be
 * paid to one of multiple nodes. This works because we encode the invoice route hints such that
 * LDK will recognize an incoming payment as destined for a phantom node, and collect the payment
 * itself without ever needing to forward to this fake node.
 *
 * Phantom node payments are useful for load balancing between multiple LDK nodes. They also
 * provide some fault tolerance, because payers will automatically retry paying other provided
 * nodes in the case that one node goes down.
 *
 * Note that multi-path payments are not supported in phantom invoices for security reasons.
 * Switching between this struct and [`KeysManager`] will invalidate any previously issued
 * invoices and attempts to pay previous invoices will fail.
