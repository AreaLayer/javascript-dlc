## API
```javascript
/**
 * Read a string of UTF-8 characters from a byte buffer.
 * Invalid characters are replaced with 'REPLACEMENT CHARACTER' (U+FFFD).
 * @see https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#the-encoding
 * @see https://stackoverflow.com/a/34926911
 * @param {!Uint8Array|!Array<number>} buffer A byte buffer.
 * @param {number=} start The buffer index to start reading.
 * @param {?number=} end The buffer index to stop reading.
 *   Assumes the buffer length if undefined.
 * @return {string}
 */
export function unpack(buffer, start=0, end=buffer.length) {}

/**
